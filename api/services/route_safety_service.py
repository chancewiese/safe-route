# api/services/route_safety_db.py
# Enhanced route safety calculations using database queries:

# Functions to implement:
# - check_route_safety_with_db(): Main safety calculation using DB data
# - get_crimes_near_route(): Efficient spatial query for nearby crimes
# - calculate_route_risk_score(): Improved scoring algorithm
# - save_route_analysis(): Store detailed analysis results

# Improvements over current file-based approach:
# - Faster spatial queries using database indexes
# - Better handling of large crime datasets
# - Historical route tracking
# - More sophisticated scoring algorithms
# - Real-time crime data updates
